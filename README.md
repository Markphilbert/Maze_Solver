This project was created using Python and a Tkinter.


<h3>Description</h3>

A python program that builds a maze and is able to solve it. Currently, tkinter is used to visualize the maze. 

First, a grid is built and then breadth-first search is used to draw the maze into the grid by deleting walls. Then, a depth-first search is used to solve the maze through a recursive function. If a dead end is hit, the drawn line will turn red to indicate a false path and another path is chosen. This continues until the exit is found.

<h3>How It's Made:</h3>

This Project was created with: 
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Tkinter</li>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optimizations</h3>

I would like to create a front-end through web development which would allow me to easily host this somewhere to be seen without the need to clone it to run it.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Through the creation of this project, I gained practical experience in applying various data structures and algorithms concepts. While I encountered challenges, mostly when implementing recursion, the process deepened my understanding of numerous computer science principles.
